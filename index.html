This is <img width=75 height=75 src="_cthulhu.jpg">Cthulhu</img> (Don't mess with him..)<br>
You are either a good guy <img width=75 height=75 src="investigator.jpg"></img><br>
or a Cultist (bad guy).. <img width=75 height=75 src="cultist.jpg"></img> or the single hidden Oberon (also a bad guy) <img width=75 height=75 src="oberon.jpg"></img>.  Note that there will be up to two bad guys in a three, four, five or six player game and a guaranteed three in larger games.<br>
This is an elder-rune-clue-good-stone <img width=75 height=75 src="rune.jpg"></img> and you want to get all of them out if you are a good guy (along with the Necronomicon <img width=75 height=75 src="necro.jpg"></img> in a game with four or more players).<br>
This is a rock <img width=75 height=75 src="rock.jpg"></img><br>
This is the torch<img width=75 height=75 src="Torch.jpg"></img>.  If you have the torch, you can click another person's face down <img width=75 height=75 src="back.jpg"></img> card to reveal it<br>
</font>
<br>
<br>
<font size=+2>Special action cards:</font><br>
<font size =-1>
<li>If your <img width=75 height=75 src="prescient_vision.jpg"></img> is revealed, you can click any card and that card will be turned face up. If it's the last card picked in a round, you get to pick the card to turn up at the start of the next round <br>
<li>If your <img width=75 height=75 src="private_eye.jpg"></img> is revealed, the person who revealed private eye will see your identity and can state truthfully that you are an evil evil cultist.  Private eye will be removed from the revealed pile and will be shuffled in for the next round </br>
<li>In four or more player games, if <img width=75 height=75 src="_cthulhu.jpg"></img> is revealed prior to the Necronomicon,<img width=75 height=75 src="necro.jpg"></img> all cultists <img width=75 height=75 src="cultist.jpg"></img> will be known to each other (note this doesn't include Oberon <img width=75 height=75 src="oberon.jpg"></img> - Oberon will not know or be known by their fellow cultists).  Cthulhu will be removed from the revealed pile and will be shuffled in for the next round </br>
<li>If you have <img width=75 height=75 src="insane.jpg"></img> you cannot communicate until the end of the round.  You may also fake insanity but you likewise cannot communicate until the end of the round.<br>
<li>If your <img width=75 height=75 src="mirage.jpg"></img> is turned up, a runestone <img width=75 height=75 src="rune.jpg"></img> will be removed from the revealed pile and will be shuffled in for the next round<br>
